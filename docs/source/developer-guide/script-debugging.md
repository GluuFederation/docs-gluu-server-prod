# Custom Script Debugging
The following guide will explain how to debug [custom interception scripts](../admin-guide/custom-script.md). 

## Setup

The following instructions assume Gluu Server 3.1.8 is already installed and available. If not, perform a standard [Gluu Server installation](../installation-guide/index.md), then do the following: 

1. Install `https://repo.gluu.org/tools/tools-install.sh`
1. Log out of CE
1. Run `/opt/gluu-server-3.1.8/opt/gluu/bin/prepare-dev-tools.py`
1. Log in to CE
1. Run `/opt/gluu/bin/eclipse.sh`

Once complete, start the PyDev debug server:

1. Open the Eclipse Debug perspective   
1. Run this command from the menu: `Pydev` > `Start Debug Server`

## Development & Debugging

Now we are ready to perform script development and debugging. Here is a quick overview:

1. In order to simplify development, put the script into a shared folder like `/root/eclipse-workspace`
1. Then instruct oxAuth to load the script from the file system *instead* of LDAP
1. Add debug instructions to the script, as specified in the next section
1. Execute the script

## Enable Remote Debug in Custom Script

1. After the import section, add:   
  
        ```
        REMOTE_DEBUG = True
  
        if REMOTE_DEBUG:
            try:
                import sys
                sys.path.append('/opt/libs/pydevd')
                import pydevd
            except ImportError as ex:
                print "Failed to import pydevd: %s" % ex
                raise
        ```     
      
1. Add the following lines wherever breakpoints are needed:   
  
        ```
        if REMOTE_DEBUG:
            pydevd.settrace('localhost', port=5678, stdoutToServer=True, stderrToServer=True)
        ```

## Sample Scenario

1. Log in to oxAuth 
1. Navigate to `Manage Custom Script Section`  
1. Expand `Basic` script section  
1. Copy the script to `/root/eclipse-workspace/basic.py`  
1. Change script `Location type` to `File`  
1. Specify the `Script Path` location to: `/root/eclipse-workspace/basic.py`  
1. Enable the script  
1. Check the following log to verify that oxAuth loaded the script properly: `/opt/gluu/jetty/oxauth/logs/oxauth_script.log`. It should look like this:    

    ```
    ... (PythonService.java:239) - Basic. Initialization

    ... (PythonService.java:239) - Basic. Initialized successfully
   
    ```

1. Open the following file in Eclipse: `/root/eclipse-workspace/basic.py` 
1. When opening the Python file for the first time, we need to instruct Eclipse to use a specific interpreter. Follow these steps:
  
    - Press the "Manual Config" button in the dialog box after opening the Python file
    - Open "PyDev->Interpreters->Jython Interpreters"
    - Click the "New..." button in the right panel. Name it "Jython" and specify the interpreter executable "/opt/jython/jython.jar"
    - Click "OK", then confirm the settings by clicking "OK" again, then "Apply and Close"
    - In the final dialog, confirm the settings by clicking "OK"

1. Open basic.py in a file editor. After the import section, add the following lines to load the PyDev libraries:

    ```  
    REMOTE_DEBUG = True  
  
    if REMOTE_DEBUG:  
        try:  
            import sys  
            sys.path.append('/opt/libs/pydevd')  
            import pydevd  
        except ImportError as ex:  
            print "Failed to import pydevd: %s" % ex  
            raise  
    ```    

1. Add this break condition to the first line in the authenticate method:

    ```  
    if REMOTE_DEBUG:   
        pydevd.settrace('localhost', port=5678, stdoutToServer=True, stderrToServer=True)  

    ```

1. Save `basic.py`   
1. Within one minute, oxAuth should load the changed file. Check the following log file again to make sure there are no load errors: `/opt/gluu/jetty/oxauth/logs/oxauth_script.log`    
1. To check if the script works, update the default authentication method to Basic Authentication. This can be performed in oxTrust by navigating to `Manage Authentication` > `Default Authentication Method`   
1. Open another browser or session and try to log in. **Make sure** to keep the first session open in order to disable the Basic Authentication method in case the script doesn't work as expected.  
1. After executing `pydevd.settrace` the script will transfer execution control to the PyDev server in Eclipse. You can use any debug commands. For example: Step Over (F6), Resume (F8), etc     
1. After debugging is finished, resume script execution to transfer execution control back to oxAuth

## X Server troubleshooting
Running `/opt/gluu-server-3.1.8/opt/gluu/bin/prepare-dev-tools.py` allows Eclipse to access X server. 

It runs the following commands:

```
# Only this one key is needed to access from chroot 
xauth -f /root/.Xauthority-gluu generate :0 . trusted 2>1 >> /root/prepare-dev-tools.log

# Generate our own key, xauth requires 128 bit hex encoding
xauth -f /root/.Xauthority-gluu add ${HOST}:0 . $(xxd -l 16 -p /dev/urandom)

# Copy result key to chroot
cp -f /root/.Xauthority-gluu /opt/gluu-server-3.1.8/root/.Xauthority

# Allow to access local server X11   
sudo su $(logname) -c "xhost +local:
```

### Unable to access x11

If Eclipse is unable to access X11, run the following command from the host to check if it has the necessary permissisons:

```
user@u144:~$ xhost +local:
non-network local connections being added to access control list
user@u144:~$ xhost 
access control enabled, only authorized clients can connect
LOCAL:
SI:localuser:user
```

If the user is still unable to access X11, remove `.Xauthority` from user home and log out/log in again.
