# Gluu Server Logs

## Overview

When it comes to troubleshooting issues in the Gluu Server-from service hiccups to outages-logs are the best place to start. 

The Gluu Server administrator can investigate logs from the oxTrust [View Logs](../admin-guide/oxtrust-ui.md#view-log-file) feature or directly with SSH access to the Gluu-Server container. 

## View Log File

Previously configured log files can be viewed using the **View log file** feature. This feature can be accessed through the configuration menu using **Configuration --> View Log File**.

![view-log](../img/admin-guide/logs/view-log.png)

The **Display last lines count** field contains the lines that will be displayed in the Web GUI. If the field contains the value **400**, then the Gluu Server will show the last 400 lines of the log in the GUI. The screenshot below shows an according example.

![tail-log](../img/admin-guide/logs/tail-log.png)

!!! Note  
    Logs can be set up for [Apache Kafka log aggregation](https://kafka.apache.org) using [this tutorial](../tutorials/kafka.md)

## Log Levels

**Logging Levels configuration through OxTrust UI**

The following log levels are available in oxTrust:

| Log Level | Messages Logged |  
|---------- |------------                  |  
|Trace      | All messages                 |  
|Debug      | Debug level and above        |  
|Info       | Informational level and above|  
|Warn       | Warning level and above      |  
|Error      | Error level and above        |  
|Fatal      | Only fatal errors            |  
|off        | Logging is disabled          |  

These logging levels can also be set in oxTrust UI.

1. Login to oxTrust UI as `admin` or with an administrator account.
1. Navigate to Configuration > JSON Configuration > OxTrust Configuration Tab.
    ![JSONConfig](../img/admin-guide/logs/json_config.png)
1. Scroll to the very bottom of the page.
1. Click on the `logging level` and select the levels from the drop down.
1. Default value will be set to `Default`, you can change the level as per your requirement for extensive
troubleshooting.
1. Click on `Save Configuration` to save the configuration.

**Changing Log Levels using log4j2.xml**

Gluu Server logs use the log4j2 logging levels which can be changed in the `log4j2.xml` file.  
`log4j2.xml` can be found in below path

`/opt/jetty-9.3/temp/jetty-localhost-8082-identity.war-_identity-any-8516765662711672787.dir`

And also the same file can be found in all incorporated Gluu apps, i.e oxAuth, Asimba, IDP, oxAuth-RP and Identity

The available logging levels are :

| Log Level | Messages Logged |  
|---------- |------------                  |  
|Trace      | All messages                 |  
|Debug      | Debug level and above        |  
|Info       | Informational level and above|  
|Warn       | Warning level and above      |  
|Error      | Error level and above        |  
|Fatal      | Only fatal errors            |  
|off        | Logging is disabled          |  


The following files define the log levels in Gluu Server. Please edit the file with the levels given above and restart the `jetty` server. The following section is taken from a live Gluu Server `log4j.xml` file showing different log levels for different logs. The changes made this section will reflect in the logs.

```
<category name="org.xdi.oxauth">
        <priority value="TRACE" />
    </category>

    <!- ############### Gluu ################# ->
    <category name="org.gluu">
        <priority value="TRACE" />
    </category>

    <!- ############### opnexdi ################# ->
    <category name="org.openxdi">
        <priority value="TRACE" />
    </category>

    <!- ############### oxTrust ################# ->

        <priority value="ERROR" />
    </category>
    <category name="com.arjuna">
        <priority value="ERROR" />
    </category>

```

Please restart the specific service after any change in log levels to allow the changes to take effect. Use the following command to restart Tomcat:

!!! Note
    It is recommended to use oxTrust UI to change the logging levels.
    
## Setup Logs
The setup logs are stored inside the `/install/community-edition-setup/` folder. There are two logs available, one detailing the setup process and the other documenting the errors:

1. setup.log
2. setup_error.log

## Core logs
The available log files for Gluu Server Community Edition inside the `chroot` environment are listed below.

### oxAuth logs
The oxAuth logs contain the information about oxAuth authentication process and errors.  
The key oxAuth logs are

1. `oxauth.log` under `/opt/gluu/jetty/oxauth/logs/`  
This log is gathering most of the authentication related information. Generally this is the first log to review for any authentication-related troubleshooting, like authentication failure or missing clients etc. Here's an example showing a successful user authentication:

        2016-07-16 15:43:28,232 INFO  [org.xdi.oxauth.auth.Authenticator] Authentication success for Client: '@!EFCB.890F.FB6C.2603!0001!0A49.F454!0008!F047.7275'
        2016-07-16 15:43:28,232 TRACE [org.xdi.oxauth.auth.Authenticator] Authentication successfully for '@!EFCB.890F.FB6C.2603!0001!0A49.F454!0008!F047.7275'
        2016-07-16 15:43:28,238 DEBUG [xdi.oxauth.token.ws.rs.TokenRestWebServiceImpl] Attempting to request access token: grantType = authorization_code, code = 61ba3c0d-42c4-4f1f-8420-fd5f6707f1b1, redirectUri = https://test.gluu.org/identity/authentication/authcode, username = null, refreshToken = null, clientId = null, ExtraParams = {grant_type=[Ljava.lang.String;@1add2a62, redirect_uri=[Ljava.lang.String;@2e0995b5, code=[Ljava.lang.String;@7743b5af}, isSecure = true, codeVerifier = null
        2016-07-16 15:43:28,249 DEBUG [org.xdi.oxauth.service.UserService] Getting user information from LDAP: userId = zico 

1. `oxauth_script.log` under `/opt/gluu/jetty/oxauth/logs/`    
  Most of the custom script's initialization and few more information are loaded here in this script. In the sample log below we can see 'Super Gluu' 2FA has been loaded in the Gluu Server:

        2016-07-16 19:06:32,705 INFO  [org.xdi.service.PythonService] (pool-2-thread-2) oxPush2. Initialization
        2016-07-16 19:06:32,713 INFO  [org.xdi.service.PythonService] (pool-2-thread-2) oxPush2. Initialize notification services

1. `oxauth_persistence_duration.log` under `/opt/gluu/jetty/oxauth/logs/`  
  This log contains information on the total execution times for LDAP operations such as `add` and `search`. It records at the `DEBUG` level, so it does not affect production environment performance.

### oxTrust logs
1. `oxtrust.log` under `/opt/gluu/jetty/identity/logs`  
  This log gather logs related to Gluu Server Admin panel (called oxTrust). For example, what is the clientID of an oxTrust session? Or, what scopes are being used, etc. In the example below, you can see an admin user has successfully logged into the `test.gluu.org` Gluu Server admin panel, has the proper authorizationCode, a redirectURI, and the user's role:

        2016-07-16 16:41:55,690 INFO  [org.gluu.oxtrust.action.Authenticator] authorizationCode : 555a7586-6ca2-4b39-ab39-2ac78ec81524

1. `oxtrust_script.log` under `/opt/gluu/jetty/identity/logs`   
  This log collects information on oxTrust related scripts and their operations. For example, if an organization uses a custom attribute which populates values for every user, then the Gluu Server Administrator needs to use a custom script for their 'Cache Refresh' process. This log will receive information when the custom script runs.

1. `oxtrust_cache_refresh.log` under `/opt/gluu/jetty/identity/logs`    
  Cache Refresh related information such as status, primary failure, etc., is available in this log. In the sample snippet below we see the total number of users that have been synced into the Gluu Server, number of failures, and total number of updated users. 

        2016-07-16 17:18:17,691 DEBUG [gluu.oxtrust.ldap.cache.service.CacheRefreshTimer] (pool-1-thread-9) Updated person '@!EFCB.890F.FB6C.2603!0001!0A49.F454!0000!40EB.AB8E'

1. `oxtrust_audit.log` under `/opt/gluu/jetty/identity/logs`  
  This log provides basic auditing for oxTrust identity. It gathers information about who did what, when, and from where in the following format:

  Date - Object changed - Who applied the change - from which IP

  For example:

    2018-09-26 09:07:55,938 INFO  [qtp804611486-16]- OPENID CLIENT @!2D59.8992.A7F7.CD81!0001!6290.A960!0008!ACA6.3181.A647.456C **MyOwnClient** ADDED  BY USER Default Admin User FROM IP ADDRESS 192.168.1.6
    
1. `oxtrust_persistence_duration.log` under `/opt/gluu/jetty/oxauth/logs/`  
  This log contains information on the total execution times for LDAP operations such as `add` and `search`. It records at the `DEBUG` level, so it does not affect production environment performance.

#### client_id and/or client_name logging
oxTrust configured to generate and view client_id and/or client_name logs. To configure client_id and/or client_name

- Log in to oxTrust UI

- Navigate to `oxTrust` > `Configuration` > `oxAuth`

- For client_id to be populated and viewed in the logs set `logClientIdOnClientAuthentication` to `true`

- For client_name to be populated and viewed in the logs set `logClientNameOnClientAuthentication` to `true`

#### System log location

These logs contain global system messages.

- For Ubuntu: `/var/log/syslog`
- For RPM based systems: `/var/log/messages`

#### Web Server log location
- For Debian: `/var/log/apache2/`
- For RPM based systems: `/var/log/httpd/` 

### Adjust Shibboleth log level

If troubleshooting SAML issues, it may be necessary to adjust the Shibboleth log level temporarily. To do so, follow these steps.

1. Navigate to `/opt/shibboleth-idp/conf/`
1. Open `logback.xml` in an editor
1. Find the following snippet:

    ```
    <!-- Logging level shortcuts. -->
    <variable name="idp.loglevel.idp" value="INFO" />
    <variable name="idp.loglevel.ldap" value="WARN" />
    <variable name="idp.loglevel.messages" value="INFO" />
    <variable name="idp.loglevel.encryption" value="INFO" />
    <variable name="idp.loglevel.opensaml" value="INFO" />
    <variable name="idp.loglevel.props" value="INFO" />
    ```
    
1. Replace `INFO` with `DEBUG` to get more logging info
1. Restart the `idp` service with `service idp stop/start`
1. Navigate to `/opt/shibboleth-idp/logs/`
1. After the issue is resolved, be sure to set the level back to `WARN` for `idp.loglevel.ldap` and `INFO` for the other logs in the production server.

## Web Server logs

Apache httpd / apache2 logs are available in `/var/log/httpd` or `/var/log/apache2` for Ubuntu.

1. `access_log`: This log contains information about requests coming into the Gluu Server, 
success status or requests, execution time for any request etc.     

1. `error_log`: This log shows error messages if the web server encounter any issue while processing incoming requests.    

1. `other_vhosts_access.log`: This log is specific to the Gluu Server setup and those links which are being requested by a user from a web browser. An example below:     

        test.gluu.org:443 192.168.201.184 - - [17/Jul/2016:18:25:21 +0000] "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1" 200 13239 "-" "Java/1.7.0_95"
        test.gluu.org:443 192.168.201.1 - - [17/Jul/2016:18:25:56 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 302 2185 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/51.0.2704.106 Safari/537.36"

1. There are few other logs like `ssl_access_log` , `ssl_error_log` , and `ssl_request_log` which are collecting information on port 443 specifically.      

Remember the initial `GET` request will hit the Apache server first, and then be proxied via the AJP port 8082 to . If you see traffic on the web server, but not on Jetty, this is a good place to check to see if something is wrong. For example, you might want to check if the firewall is blocking port 8082 if you see something like this:

        [Thu Jul 14 23:49:19 2016] [error] ajp_read_header: ajp_ilink_receive failed
        [Thu Jul 14 23:49:19 2016] [error] (70007)The timeout specified has expired: proxy: read response failed from (null) (localhost)
        [Thu Jul 14 23:49:20 2016] [error] (70007)The timeout specified has expired: ajp_ilink_receive() can't receive header

        [Thu Jul 14 23:49:20 2016] [error] (70007)The timeout specified has expired: proxy: read response failed from (null) (localhost)

## OpenLDAP Logs

OpenLDAP logs are enabled by default. And OpenLDAP by is configured to capture logs by syslog from the operating system. However, if one has to disable logging (which we dont recommend), are done in sladp.conf stored under following directory.  
For more details on OpenLDAP slapd configuration view [here](http://www.openldap.org/doc/admin24/slapdconfig.html)  

`/opt/symas/etc/openldap/slapd.conf file`

The logs for OpenLDAP are stored under the below directory.

`/var/log/openldap/ldap.log`

!!! Note
    OpenLDAP logs are not populated within Gluu container, its stored and generated under the host system

### OpenLDAP Log Level

By default Log Level of OpenLDAP is set to `stats sync`. If one has to change the log level, it could be performed by modifying the slapd.conf file under the above mentioned directory. 

`loglevel stats sync`

|Level|Keyword|Description|
|-----|-------|-----------|
|-1 | any | enable all debugging  |
|0 | *blank* |no debugging  |
|1 |trace|  trace function calls  |
|2  |packets | debug packet handling  |
|4  | args| heavy trace debugging  |
|8  | conns| connection management  |
|16 |  BER | print out packets sent and received  |
|32 |  filter|  search filter processing  |
|64 |  config|  configuration processing  |
|128 | ACL | access control list processing  |
|256 | stats|  stats log connections/operations/results  |
|512 |  stats2 | stats log entries sent  |
|1024|   shell | print communication with shell backends  |
|2048|  parse | print entry parsing debugging  |
|16384|  sync|  syncrepl consumer processing  |
|32768 |  none|  only messages that get logged whatever log level is set  |

## Clearing Logs

The "clear-logs" feature can be used to clear all log files with the extension `.log`, including system logs. Clear-logs can be helpful during troubleshooting, as well as research and development. We discourage its use in production systems if the logs are not backed-up. More features are planned. Please consider this as work in progress.

`# service gluu-server-3.1.8 clear-logs`
