# Gluu Server Patches

## oxTrust Unauthorized Access
### May 21, 2019

### Affected versions
All versions of the Gluu Server

### Issue Description

The following page in oxTrust is not properly protected:

```
../identity/authentication/finishlogin/
```

Navigating to this URL directly obtains an unauthorized session for a random user.

Normally, oxAuth sends a request with an authorization code to oxTrust at `../identity/authentication/getauthcode`. oxTrust then uses that code to obtain the user's `id_token` and personal claims, then redirects to `../finishlogin`.

Navigating directly to `../finishlogin` without meaningful session context caused `entryManager` to build an `objectClass=gluuPerson` filter without `uid=user_name`. This returned all users and created an unauthorized session for the first user on that list.

### Fix Description

The patch below adds two lines to the `finishlogin` xhtml file to catch null `user-id` parameters. Once applied, unauthenticated attempts to access this URL will be blocked.

!!! Note
    As the administrative portal for your authentication service, we always recommend **blocking public access to oxTrust**. Learn how [in the docs](https://gluu.org/docs/ce/operation/security/#securing-oxtrust).
    
### Steps to apply fix

The steps below apply to **all** affected Gluu Server versions.

!!! Note
    A 5-minute maintenance window is needed to apply the fix. Make sure to test and confirm in a non-production environment first. 

- [Back up your Gluu Server](https://gluu.org/docs/ce/operation/backup/)  -- either a VM snapshot or a tarball of the Gluu Server container.
 
- Log into your Gluu Server container:

    - For Centos 6.x, Red Hat 6.x, Ubuntu 14/16, and Debian 8:
    
    ```
    # service gluu-server-3.1.8 login
    ```
    
    - For Centos 7.x, Red Hat 7.x and Debian 9:
    
    ```
    # /sbin/gluu-serverd-3.1.8 login
    ```

- Download the patch script:

    ```
    wget https://repo.gluu.org/upd/security_patch_identity-2.py
    ```
    
- Run the command:

    ```
    chmod +x security_patch_identity-2.py
    ```
    
- Run the command:

    ```
    python security_patch_identity-2.py
    ```
    
- Open an incognito window in your browser and attempt to access the affected page: https://{hostname}/identity/authentication/finishlogin . If it results in a blank page, the patch was successful.

## OPENDJ-2969 
### February 15, 2019

### Affected versions
- All Gluu versions (2.x - 3.x), any installation using Gluu OpenDJ

### Description
OpenDJ 3.0 is affected by a bug preventing the replication server from successfully starting if the size of certain changelog (binary) files becomes a multiple of 256. 

Upgrading to a fixed OpenDJ 3.5 or 4.0 package isn't possible at the time of writting due to licensing. The only possible workaround is to rename/remove the `changeDBlog/` dir before starting OpenDJ's JVM. Thus a workaround was developed by the Gluu Team in attempt to mitigate its impact, which automates the process and does it transparenlty to an user.

If the bug presents itself, when starting the Gluu Server you will see an error like: 

`category=SYNC severity=ERROR msgID=org.opends.messages.replication.274 msg=The following log '/opt/opendj/changelogDb/2.dom/1234.server' must be released but it is not referenced."`

More info on the [OpenDJ jira](https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/OPENDJ-2969).

### Steps to Fix

!!! Note
    Only if the bug is observed should the workaround documented below be implemented.

#### Patching steps

Follow next steps to apply the patch:

1. All work should be done inside Gluu-Server container. 

1. Put patching script at `/usr/local/sbin/check_changelog.sh` (see source code of it below)   

1. Edit `/opt/opendj/bin/start-ds` script by adding section calling the patch script to the beginning of it (see diff below for clues)    
1. Set proper permissions for the patch script: `# chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/check_changelog.sh; chown ldap:ldap /usr/local/sbin/check_changelog.sh`

When service is started/restarted, if unsafe condition is detected, script will rename the current `changeDBlog/` dir to `changeDBlog.TIMESTAMP/` and then will allow `start-ds` script to proceed with starting OpenDJ, expecting it to re-create the directory.

#### Patch script's source

```
#!/bin/bash

base=`basename $PWD`
TODAY=`date +%Y%m%d_%H%M`
changeDBlog="/opt/opendj/changelogDb"

date=`date "+%y%m%d-%H%M%S"`

files=`find $changeDBlog -name "head.log" -print` 
for file in $files; do
	size=`ls -l $file | awk '{print $5}'`
	check1=`expr ${size} / 256`
	check2=`expr 256 \* ${check1}`
	if [ "${size}" = "${check2}" -a "${check1}" != "0" ]; then
		echo "ALERT! $file has size as multiple of 256..."
		echo "Renaming $changeDBlog as ${changeDBlog}.$TODAY"
		mv $changeDBlog ${changeDBlog}.$TODAY
		break
	fi
done
echo "Moving towards normal opendj start now..."
```

#### Diff between the modified and original `start-ds` files

```
# diff -c /opt/opendj/bin/start-ds-new /opt/opendj/bin/start-ds
*** /opt/opendj/bin/start-ds-new	2018-02-12 12:17:38.534685038 -0500
--- /opt/opendj/bin/start-ds	2016-04-20 07:16:29.000000000 -0400

#### Double checking

To confirm, compare the amount of entries between all replicated trees of nodes after completing the above steps. Even if there is no error in replication, there might still be a difference between node A and node B. In the event this happens, disable/re-enable the whole replication operation.
