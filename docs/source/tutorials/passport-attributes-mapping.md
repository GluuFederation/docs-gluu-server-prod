# Passport attributes mapping

## Overview

A mapping is a mechanism that defines how profile data released by an external provider (eg. a SAML IDP) is saved to local Gluu LDAP.

In Passport 3.1.x, attribute mappings worked in a declarative manner, where administrators potentially had to supply information at different places: custom scripts (via config properties), JSON files, and sometimes in Javascript (Node.js) code. Starting with version 4.0, mappings were moved to Javascript files entirely.

Physically, a mapping is stored in a node module file with a single function that receives as input a profile object and returns an object whose properties (ie. dictionary keys) are the names of Gluu LDAP attributes. The value(s) of each key will contain the data that will be persisted to LDAP.

As an example, consider the following node module `myMapping.js`:

```
module.exports = profile => {
	return {
		uid: profile.username,
		mail: profile.emails[0].value,
		displayName: profile.displayName,
	}
}
```

Here, the `profile =>` syntax is equivalent to `function (profile)`, namely a function with a single parameter named `profile`. This function returns an object with properties `uid`, `mail`, and `displayName` taking values from `profile` object. This routine dictates which data will be persisted at destination as we'll shortly see.

A configured identity provider uses exactly one mapping but one mapping can be used by any number of providers. Mappings are stored in directory `/opt/gluu/node/passport/server/mappings` of Gluu chroot. When you specify the mapping for a given provider in oxTrust, you supply the filename (excluding the extension).

## How mappings work

When users authenticate at an external provider, the corresponding [passport strategy](../authn-guide/passport.md#strategies) (node library) creates an object based on the data received. It normally applies some simple logic to extract common attributes such as display name, last name, e-mail, etc. 

The designated mapping function will be called using the object built by the strategy as the argument, then the resulting output will be sent to the corresponding custom script (`passport_social` or `passport_saml`), where the actual insertion or update of the user entry takes place in LDAP. From there, the flow proceeds so the end-user can get access to the final destination (OIDC RP or SP).

Most Passport strategies simplify the profile data and apparently few of the original information will be available for applying the mapping function. If you want access to the full data (released by the external provider), you have to inspect `_json` property of the profile object. For example:

```
module.exports = profile => {
	return {
		...
		local_attribute: profile._json.some_remote_attribute
		...
	}
}
```

## Custom object classes

Since properties of the returned object map directly to LDAP attributes, you **must** also supply object classes in case some attributes do not belong to `gluuPerson`. As an example, if you plan to set the `mobile` attribute, you have to set `objectClass` values explicitly:

```
module.exports = profile => {
	return {
		objectClass: ["gluuPerson", "gluuCustomPerson"],
		mobile: ...
		...
	}
}
```

As another example, to set the `eduPersonPrincipalName` attribute, you must provide `["gluuPerson", "eduPerson"]` for `objectClass`.

!!! Note
    If all attributes simply belong to `gluuPerson` there is no need to explicitly set `objectClass`.

## About assigning mappings

When integrating a new external provider for inbound identity in oxTrust, an existing mapping has to be associated with that provider. Based on the type of provider, the UI will make a recommendation for this field. Administrators must determine if the suggestion fits their needs or if a separate new mapping has to be created. 

## Creating and debugging a mapping

While configuring an external provider, it is handy to see a mapping in action. Adding print statements in the mapping function is an easy way to inspect data going in and out. Here is an example:

```js
module.exports = profile => {
	console.log(JSON.stringify(profile))
	return {
		uid: profile.username,
		mail: profile.emails[0].value,
		displayName: profile.displayName
	}
}
```

The above simply prints the profile object in JSON notation. Note that any number of (valid Javascript) statements can be added before the `return` keyword.

Save the file in `/opt/gluu/node/passport/server/mappings`, restart Passport (by using `/opt/dist/scripts/passport restart`) and trigger the authentication flow in the browser for the attribute mapping to take place. To see the printed output, tail the `/opt/gluu/node/passport/logs/start.log` file.

You can also use `utils/logging` utility with `logger.log2()` function. It will print logs in `/opt/gluu/node/passport/logs/passport.log` file.

```js
const logger = require('../utils/logging')

module.exports = profile => {
  logger.log2('debug', `profile json : ${JSON.stringify(profile)}`)

  return {
    uid: profile.username || profile.id,
    mail: profile.email,
    cn: profile.displayName,
    displayName: profile.displayName,
    givenName: profile.name.givenName,
    sn: profile.name.familyName
  }
}
```

Once debugging is finished, all log statements should be removed or commented out.

!!! Note
    If you are not able to see any printed messages, there might be an issue in a previous step of the flow. Check the [logs](../authn-guide/passport.md#logging) to troubleshoot and ensure you have restarted passport as instructed above.


## Applying attributes transformation

One benefit of the attribute mapping approach used in Passport is that custom logic can be introduced. The function to code can be simple as those found in out-of-the-box mappings or arbitrarily complex. Administrators can do any sort of transformations to incoming attributes so that they match their needs in detail.

Common use cases include meeting length or format restrictions for destination attributes in LDAP. As an example suppose the attribute `birthdate` is present in the input profile. If this date is represented as an integer (relative to the "unix epoch"), it is clear a transformation is needed so that it can be stored in `birthdate` LDAP attribute which follows the [generalized time](https://ldapwiki.com/wiki/GeneralizedTime) syntax. Here is how this can be achieved:

```
module.exports = profile => {
	let d = new Date()
	d.setTime(profile.birthdate)

	let	year = d.getUTCFullYear(),
		month = d.getUTCMonth() + 1,
		day = d.getUTCDate()

	month = (month < 10 ? "0" : "") + month
	day = (day < 10 ? "0" : "") + day
	
	return {
		...
		birthdate: year + month + day + "00Z"
		...
	}
}
```

Note that being a node module, any third-party library can be imported to aid the processing. The library must be installed in `/opt/gluu/jetty/node/passport` as a prerequisite.

## Advanced: sending more than profile data to custom script

As mentioned [above](#how-mappings-work), the value returned by the mapping function is sent to oxAuth for further processing at the custom script. There may be cases where data other than profile data is desired to be passed. 

A trivial case is that of sending a constant value. That can be achieved by using something like:

```
module.exports = profile => {
	return {
		...
		myattribute: value, 
		...
	}
}
```
where `value` is a constant literal such as `"banana"`, `false`, or `[50, 60]`. Note that `myattribute` may or may not be an existing attribute in LDAP. If existing the value will be stored, otherwise the flow will throw an error. In the case of Couchbase the value will be persisted since it is schemaless database.

When you want to explicitly skip the attempt to persist a certain attribute part of the mapping, you have to edit the corresponding script (`passport_social` or `passport_saml`) so that:

a) The attribute is ignored for user provisioning
b) Some custom manipulation takes place with the attribute received

For *a*, add proper logic in method `fillUser` so that `attribute` is skipped. Actually `"provider"` is already left out as you will see.

For *b*, the attribute value can be obtained from `user_profile` variable of the script (see `authenticate` method for step 1). Use something like `user_profile['fruit']`. The value obtained will always be an array: if `value` was assigned a simple expression in the mapping, the array will contain a single element.

### Accessing extra data from the passport strategy

Depending on the strategy in use, eg. `passport-github`, `passport-saml`, etc., it is possible to get information other than actual profile data. This may include an access token, refresh token, and other contextual information specific to every strategy.

To get an idea of what you may have access to, consult the documentation (preferably the code) of the strategy with regards to the **verify** function. Here we describe an example of how to get the access token obtained from an OpenID-Client provider when the `openid-client` is used. Note that this is not the Gluu access token but that of an external OP integrated for inbound identity using passport.

To start, check all callback parameters of [openid-client here](https://github.com/panva/node-openid-client/tree/main/docs#new-strategyoptions-verify). You will see different calls to a "verify" function where the number of parameters supplied varies. Note that besides `userinfo` there are token data `tokenset`. In token set you will get `access_token`, `refresh_token` and `id_token`.

To access these kind of data do:

1. Pick the most convenient call of `verify` (the one that exhibits the data of your interest) and count the number of parameters in the call (this is called the "arity" of a function). 
1. In Gluu chroot, `/opt/gluu/node/passport/server/extra-passport-params.js` file is already setup with `verifyCallbackArity: 3` that mean you will get `tokenset` :
    ```
  	{
  	  strategy: 'openid-client',
  	  passportAuthnParams: {
  	    scope: 'openid email profile'
  	  },
  	  options: {},
  	  verifyCallbackArity: 3
  	}
    ```

1. Edit the mapping in use (eg. `/opt/gluu/node/passport/server/mappings/openid-client.js`) so that the function now has 2 arguments, like:
    ```
    module.exports = (profile, params) => {
    ```

1. Manipulate `params` as desired. It contains an array with all the parameters of the `verify` call you picked except for the last one and the profile (which is the first argument of the mapping function). For example,
    ```
	module.exports = (profile, params) => {
  		console.log('All Params: ', params)
  		const token = params[0].access_token
  		console.log('Access Token: ', token)
  		return {
  		  uid: profile.sub,
  		  mail: profile.email,
  		  cn: profile.given_name,
  		  displayName: profile.name,
  		  givenName: profile.given_name,
  		  sn: profile.name.family_name
  		}
    }
    ```
1. Save your changes and restart passport
1. Edit your custom script so that `access_token` is processed as desired.
