# OpenID Connect API

## OpenID Connect Authorization Grant

This page provides an interface to request authorization through REST web services.

## Authorization Endpoint

`/.well-known/openid-configuration`

### Path
`/oxauth/restv1/authorize`

### requestAuthorizationGet

**GET** `/oxauth/restv1/authorize`

The authorization endpoint performs end-user authentication. This is done by sending the user agent to the authorization server using request parameters defined by OAuth 2.0 and additional parameters and parameter values defined by OpenID Connect.

### URL
`http://<hostname of Gluu Server>/oxauth/restv1/authorize`

### Parameters

The **response_type** parameter determines the authorization processing flows, 
including the parameters returned from the endpoints. These values can be code or a combination of 
the values, and can be a combination of `code`, `token`, and/or `id_token`.

## Using JWTs for Passing Request Parameters

To enable authentication requests to be signed and optionally encrypted, authorization request parameters are used, listed below. These requests are passed as Request Objects in two ways, `by value` and `by reference`.

<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <th>Parameter</th>
        <th>Description</th>
		<th>Required</th>
    </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>requests</td>
            <td>This parameter enables OpenID Connect requests to be passed in a single, self-contained parameter and to be optionally signed and/or encrypted. The parameter value is a Request Object value,It represents the request as a JWT whose Claims are the request parameters.</td>
			<td>Optional</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>request_uri</td>
            <td>This parameter enables OpenID Connect requests to be passed by reference, rather than by value. The request_uri value is a URL using the https scheme referencing a resource containing a Request Object value, which is a JWT containing the request parameters.</td>
			<td>Optional</td>
        </tr>
</table>

## Request Object by Value
The `request` Authorization Request parameter is used to enable OpenID Connect requests to pass single, self-contained parameter and optionally signed and/or encrypred. The request is represented as a JWT whose claims are request parameters. This JWT is called a Request Object. The `request` parameter is **Optional**. When the `request` parameter is used, the OpenID connect request parameter values contained in JWT supersede those passed using OAuth 2.0 request syntax.  However, parameters MAY also be passed using the OAuth 2.0 request syntax even when a Request Object is used; this would typically be done to enable a cached, pre-signed (and possibly pre-encrypted) Request Object value to be used containing the fixed request parameters, while parameters that can vary with each request, such as state and nonce, are passed as OAuth 2.0 parameters. 

The request to be valid in OAuth 2.0 Authorization Request, values for `response_type` and `client_id` parameters MUST be included using the OAuth 2.0 request syntax, since they are REQUIRED by OAuth 2.0. The values for these parameters MUST match those in the Request Object.

`request` and `request_uri` parameters MUST NOT be included in Request Objects.
	
The following is a non-normative example of the claims in a Request Object before base64url encoding and signing: 
	
	
	  {
	   "iss": "s6BhdRkqt3",
	   "aud": "https://server.example.com",
	   "response_type": "code id_token",
	   "client_id": "s6BhdRkqt3",
	   "redirect_uri": "https://client.example.org/cb",
	   "scope": "openid",
	   "state": "af0ifjsldkj",
	   "nonce": "n-0S6_WzA2Mj",
	   "max_age": 86400,
	   "claims":
		{
		 "userinfo":
		  {
		   "given_name": {"essential": true},
		   "nickname": null,
		   "email": {"essential": true},
		   "email_verified": {"essential": true},
		   "picture": null
		  },
		 "id_token":
		  {
		   "gender": null,
		   "birthdate": {"essential": true},
		   "acr": {"values": ["urn:mace:incommon:iap:silver"]}
		  }
		}
	  }

	

###  Using the `request` Request Parameter

The Client sends the Authorization Request to the Authorization Endpoint. 

The following is a non-normative example of an Authorization Request using the request parameter (with line wraps within values for display purposes only):

## Request Object by Reference
The `request_uri` Authorization Request parameter enables OpenID Connect 
requests to be passed by reference, rather than by value. 
This parameter is used identically to the request parameter, other than that the 
Request Object value is retrieved from the resource at the specified URL, rather than 
passed by value. 

The `request_uri_parameter_supported` Discovery result indicates whether the OP 
supports this parameter. Should an OP not support this parameter and an RP uses it, 
the OP MUST return the `request_uri_not_supported` error.  When `request_uri` parameter is used, 
the OpenID Connect request parameter values contained in the referenced JWT supersede 
those passed using the OAuth 2.0 request syntax. However, parameters MAY also be passed using 
the OAuth 2.0 request syntax even when a `request_uri` is used; this would typically be done 
to enable a cached, pre-signed (and possibly pre-encrypted) Request Object value to be used 
containing the fixed request parameters, while parameters that can vary with each request, 
such as state and nonce, are passed as OAuth 2.0 parameters. 

The request to be a valid OAuth 2.0 Authorization Request, 
values for the `response_type` and `client_id` parameters MUST be included 
using the OAuth 2.0 request syntax, since they are REQUIRED by OAuth 2.0. 
The values for these parameters MUST match those in the Request Object

### URL Referencing the Request Object

The Client stores the Request Object resource either locally or remotely at a 
URL the Server can access. This URL is the Request URI, `request_uri`. 

If values for Claims are included in the Request Object, it MUST NOT be revealed 
to anybody but the Authorization Server. As such, the `request_uri` MUST have appropriate 
entropy for its lifetime. It is RECOMMENDED that it be removed if it is known that 
it will not be used again or after a reasonable timeout unless access control measures are taken. 

The following is a non-normative example of a Request URI value 
(with line wraps within values for display purposes only):

### Using the `request_uri` Request Parameter Request
The Client sends the Authorization Request to the Authorization Endpoint. 

The following is a non-normative example of an Authorization Request using the request_uri parameter (with line wraps within values for display purposes only): 

	
	  https://server.example.com/oxauth/restv1/authorize?
		response_type=code%20id_token
		&client_id=s6BhdRkqt3
		&request_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Frequest.jwt
		%23GkurKxf5T0Y-mnPFCHqWOMiZi4VS138cQO_V7PZHAdM
		&state=af0ifjsldkj&nonce=n-0S6_WzA2Mj
		&scope=openid

#### Response
##### Successful Response
 The authorization server issues an access token and optional refresh
   token, and constructs the response by adding the following parameters
   to the entity-body of the HTTP response with a 200 (OK) status code:

## OpenID Connect Token Endpoint

### Overview


#### Path

`/oxauth/restv1/token`**

#### requestAccessToken

**POST** `/oxauth/restv1/token`

To obtain an Access Token, an ID Token, and optionally a Refresh Token,
the RP (Client) sends a Token Request to the Token Endpoint to obtain a
Token Response. Token Endpoint requires Client Authentication methods to 
authenticate clients to the authorization server.

## API for oxAuth Clientinfo 

This document provides an interface for Client Info REST web services.

### Path

`/oxauth/restv1/clientinfo`

### Overview

The ClientInfo Endpoint is an OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource that returns Claims about the registered client.

#### clientinfoGet

|Parameter|Description|Data Type|
|---------|-----------|---------|
|access_token |The access token for oxAuth|string|
|authorization| The authorization for the client|string|

#### clientinfoPost

|Parameter|Description|Data Type|
|---------|-----------|---------|
|access_token |The access token for oxAuth|string|
|authorization| The authorization for the client|string|

## OpenID Connect Register Client API

### Overview

Any OpenID Client needs to register with the OpenID Provider to utilize 
OpenID Services, in this case register a user, and acquire a client ID and a shared secret.

!!! Note
    It's possible to specify additional parameters, which can be sent in registration and registration management requests in addition to standard ones defined by corresponding specifications. It allows, for example, to set and modify Gluu's proprietary client properties that are otherwise inaccessible via this protocol. Additional parameters are added as items under the "dynamicRegistrationCustomAttributes" section at "Configuration -> JSON Configuration -> oxAuth" page. Each item must contain the name of the LDAP attribute storing the corresponding property's value (which is usually different from the displayed name of the property). By default it allows setting only the "oxAuthTrustedClient" attribute which corresponds to the "Pre-Authorization" property.

### Path

`/oxauth/restv1/register`

### registerPost

**POST** `/oxauth/restv1/register`

Registers new dynamic client in oxAuth.

#### URL
   http://gluu.org/oxauth/restv1/register

#### Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|---------|--------|
|redirect_uris|Redirection URI values used by the Client. One of these registered Redirection URI values must exactly match the redirect_uri parameter value used in each Authorization Request|
|response_types|A list of the OAuth 2.0 response_type values that the Client is declaring that it will restrict itself to using. If omitted, the default is that the Client will use only the code Response Type. Allowed values are code, token, id_token|
|grant_types|A list of the OAuth 2.0 Grant Types that the Client is declaring that it will restrict itself to using. The Grant Type values used by OpenID Connect are:<ul><li>**authorization_code** The Authorization Code Grant Type</li><li>**implicit** The Implicit Grant Type</li><li>**refresh_token** The Refresh Token Grant Type</li></ul>The following table lists the correspondence between response_type values that the Client will use and grant_type values that MUST be included in the registered grant_types list:<ul><li>code: authorization_code</li><li>id_token: implicit</li><li>token id_token: implicit</li><li>code id_token: authorization_code, implicit</li><li>code token: authorization_code, implicit</li><li>code token id_token: authorization_code, implicit</li></ul>|
|application_type|Kind of the application. The default, if omitted, is web. The defined values are native or web. Web Clients using the OAuth Implicit Grant Type must only register URLs using the HTTPS scheme as redirect_uris; they must not use localhost as the hostname. Native Clients must only register redirect_uris using custom URI schemes or URLs using the http: scheme with localhost as the hostname.|
|contacts|e-mail addresses of people responsible for this Client.|
|client_name|Name of the Client to be presented to the End-User.|
|logo_uri|URL that references a logo for the Client application. If present, the server displays this image to the end user during approval. The value of this field must point to a valid image file.|
|client_uri|URL of the home page of the Client. The value of this field must point to a valid Web page. If present, the server displays this URL to the end user in a followable fashion.|
|policy_uri|URL that the Relying Party Client provides to the End-User to read about the how the profile data will be used. The value of this field must point to a valid web page. The OpenID Provider displays this URL to the End-User if it is given.|
|tos_uri|URL that the Relying Party Client provides to the End-User to read about the Relying Party's terms of service. The value of this field must point to a valid web page. The OpenID Provider displays this URL to the End-User if it is given.|
|jwks_uri|URL for the Client's JSON Web Key Set (JWK) document. If the Client signs requests to the Server, it contains the signing key(s) the Server uses to validate signatures from the Client. The JWK Set may also contain the Client's encryption keys(s), which are used by the Server to encrypt responses to the Client. When both signing and encryption keys are made available, a use (Key Use) parameter value is required for all keys in the referenced JWK Set to indicate each key's intended usage. Although some algorithms allow the same key to be used for both signatures and encryption, doing so is not recommended, as it is less secure. The JWK x5c parameter MAY be used to provide X.509 representations of keys provided. When used, the bare key values must still be present and must match those in the certificate.|
|jwks|Client's JSON Web Key Set (JWK) document, passed by value. The semantics of the jwks parameter are the same as the jwks_uri parameter, other than that the JWK Set is passed by value, rather than by reference. This parameter is intended only to be used by Clients that, for some reason, are unable to use the jwks_uri parameter, for instance, by native applications that might not have a location to host the contents of the JWK Set. If a Client can use jwks_uri, it must not use jwks. One significant downside of jwks is that it does not enable key rotation (which jwks_uri does). The jwks_uri and jwks parameters must not be used together.|
|sector_identifier_uri|URL using the https scheme to be used in calculating Pseudonymous Identifiers by the OP. The URL references a file with a single JSON array of redirect_uri values. Providers that use pairwise sub (subject) values utilizes the sector_identifier_uri value provided in the Subject Identifier calculation for pairwise identifiers.|
|subject_type|subject_type requested for responses to this Client. The subject_types_supported Discovery parameter contains a list of the supported subject_type values for this server. Valid types include pairwise and public.|
|id_token_signed_response_alg|JWS alg algorithm (JWA) required for signing the ID Token issued to this Client. The value none must not be used as the ID Token alg value unless the Client uses only Response Types that return no ID Token from the Authorization Endpoint (such as when only using the Authorization Code Flow). The default, if omitted, is RS256. The public key for validating the signature is provided by retrieving the JWK Set referenced by the jwks_uri element from OpenID Connect Discovery.|
|id_token_encrypted_response_alg|JWE alg algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting the ID Token issued to this Client. If this is requested, the response will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that no encryption is performed.|
|id_token_encrypted_response_enc|JWE enc algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting the ID Token issued to this Client. If id_token_encrypted_response_alg is specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256. When id_token_encrypted_response_enc is included, id_token_encrypted_response_alg must also be provided.|
|userinfo_signed_response_alg|JWS alg algorithm (JWA) required for signing UserInfo Responses. If this is specified, the response will be JWT serialized, and signed using JWS. The default, if omitted, is for the UserInfo Response to return the Claims as a UTF-8 encoded JSON object using the application/json content-type.|
|userinfo_encrypted_response_alg|JWE alg algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting UserInfo Responses. If both signing and encryption are requested, the response will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that no encryption is performed.|
|userinfo_encrypted_response_enc|JWE enc algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting UserInfo Responses. If userinfo_encrypted_response_alg is specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256. When userinfo_encrypted_response_enc is included, userinfo_encrypted_response_alg must also be provided.|
|request_object_signing_alg| JWS alg algorithm (JWA) that must be used for signing Request Objects sent to the OP. All Request Objects from this Client are rejected, if not signed with this algorithm. This algorithm is used both when the Request Object is passed by value (using the request parameter) and when it is passed by reference (using the request_uri parameter). The value none may be used. The default, if omitted, is that any algorithm supported by the OP and the RP may be used.|
|request_object_encryption_alg| JWE alg algorithm (JWA) the RP is declaring that it may use for encrypting Request Objects sent to the OP. This parameter should be included when symmetric encryption will be used, since this signals to the OP that a client_secret value needs to be returned from which the symmetric key will be derived, that might not otherwise be returned. The RP may still use other supported encryption algorithms or send unencrypted Request Objects, even when this parameter is present. If both signing and encryption are requested, the Request Object will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that the RP is not declaring whether it might encrypt any Request Objects.|
|request_object_encryption_enc|JWE enc algorithm (JWA) the RP is declaring that it may use for encrypting Request Objects sent to the OP. If request_object_encryption_alg is specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256. When request_object_encryption_enc is included, request_object_encryption_alg must also be provided.|
|token_endpoint_auth_method|Requested Client Authentication method for the Token Endpoint. The options are client_secret_post, client_secret_basic, client_secret_jwt, private_key_jwt, and none. If omitted, the default is client_secret_basic, the HTTP Basic Authentication Scheme.|
|token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg|JWS alg algorithm (JWA) that must be used for signing the JWT used to authenticate the Client at the Token Endpoint for the private_key_jwt and client_secret_jwt authentication methods. All Token Requests using these authentication methods from this Client are rejected, if the JWT is not signed with this algorithm. The value none must not be used. The default, if omitted, is that any algorithm supported by the OP and the RP MAY be used.|
|default_max_age|Default Maximum Authentication Age. Specifies that the End-User must be actively authenticated if the End-User was authenticated longer ago than the specified number of seconds. The max_age request parameter overrides this default value. If omitted, no default Maximum Authentication Age is specified.|
|require_auth_time|Boolean value specifying whether the auth_time Claim in the ID Token is required. It is required when the value is true. (If this is false, the auth_time Claim can still be dynamically requested as an individual Claim for the ID Token using the claims request parameter) If omitted, the default value is false.|
|default_acr_values|Default requested Authentication Context Class Reference values. Array of strings that specifies the default acr values that the OP is being requested to use for processing requests from this Client, with the values appearing in order of preference. The Authentication Context Class satisfied by the authentication performed is returned as the acr Claim Value in the issued ID Token. The acr Claim is requested as a Voluntary Claim by this parameter. The acr_values_supported discovery element contains a list of the supported acr values supported by this server. Values specified in the acr_values request parameter or an individual acr Claim request override these default values.|
|initiate_login_uri|URI using the https scheme that a third party can use to initiate a login by the RP. The URI must accept requests via both GET and POST. The Client must understand the login_hint and iss parameters and should support the target_link_uri parameter.|
|request_uris|request_uri values that are pre-registered by the RP for use at the OP. The Servers cache the contents of the files referenced by these URIs and not retrieve them at the time they are used in a request. OPs can require that request_uri values used be pre-registered with the require_request_uri_registration discovery parameter. If the contents of the request file could ever change, these URI values should include the base64url encoded SHA-256 hash value of the file contents referenced by the URI as the value of the URI fragment. If the fragment value used for a URI changes, that signals the server that its cached value for that URI with the old fragment value is no longer valid.|
|tls_client_auth_subject_dn|An string representation of the expected subject distinguished name of the certificate, which the OAuth client will use in mutual TLS authentication.|
|access_token_as_jwt|Boolean controlling whether to return the `access_token` as a JWT. It is false by default.|
|access_token_signing_alg|signing algorithm that has to be used during JWT signing. If it's not specified, then the default OP signing algorithm will be used (specified via `defaultSignatureAlgorithm` oxAuth configuration property).|
|run_introspection_script_before_access_token_as_jwt_creation_and_include_claims|Boolean value with default value false. If true and `access_token_as_jwt=true` then run introspection script and transfer claims into JWT.|
|keep_client_authorization_after_expiration|Boolean value with default value false. If true then client authorization will not be removed afer expiration (expiration date is same as client's expiration that created it).|

#### Response

#### Client Registration Response

Upon successful registration, the client registration returns the newly-created Client Identifier and, if applicable, a Client Secret, along with all registered Metadata about this Client, including any fields provisioned by the Authorization Server itself. The Authorization Server MAY reject or replace any of the Client's requested field values and substitute them with suitable values. If this happens, the Authorization Server MUST include these fields in the response to the Client. An Authorization Server MAY ignore values provided by the client, and MUST ignore any fields sent by the Client that it does not understand. 

The response MAY contain a Registration Access Token that can be used by the Client to perform subsequent operations upon the resulting Client registration. 

A successful response SHOULD use the HTTP 201 Created status code and return a JSON document [RFC4627] using the application/json content type with the following fields and the Client Metadata parameters as top-level members of the root JSON object:
